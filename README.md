## Issues Encountered
Install: mhn is obsolete with Ubuntu 14.04 and its better to use g1-small instead of f1-micro as VM type.

mhn-admin crashed the last day. I needed to reboot, but I lose the list of malwares before shutdown.
I have no attack reports for the 2 agave and I still not understand why.

## Summary of attacks
Dionaea: 2.591.478 attacks, 12 malware samples.
